    <p>Babylon is real.</p>

    <p>There are many people today who follow Jesus who instinctively know that something is awry when it comes to the Body of Christ, that is, the collection of people who have been born again by trusting in Jesus to cleanse them from their sins. Now, as to why they feel this way, they can't quite put their finger on it. Perhaps, it has something to do with their emotions. Or perhaps, it relates to their inability to find out what it is that God wants them to do with their lives. Whatever the case may be, one thing is certain: Something is definitely wrong.</p>

    <p>There are also many believers who cling to the notion that as long as they do their best day by day, everything is going to work out somehow. Perhaps, it can be called optimism. Or perhaps, it might be called hope of some sort. One thing is for sure: People are afraid of the truth when it comes to spiritual matters if it turns out being unpleasant. As to why this might be, it might be that they have been brought up to believe in the best of things regardless of circumstances.</p>

    <p>Why do we mention these scenarios? It's because people are conditioned to react to the things of God in a certain way. They may not realize it, but they are proceeding along a path that will lead to unhappy endings. But why?</p>

    <p>The Body of Christ is currently being held hostage by a spiritual kingdom known as Babylon. Many people are not aware that Babylon exists! They think that Babylon solely refers to the kingdom that sacked Judah in the Old Testament. They fail to realize that Babylon is mentioned countless times in the Bible and in such a way that it cannot possibly refer to the aforementioned kingdom.</p>

    <p>So then, what is Babylon like? We can find some clues from various Biblical passages, of which one would be Isaiah 14: 7-8</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>"The whole earth is at rest and is quiet;<br />
      They break forth into shouts of joy.<br />
      Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying,<br />
      'Since you were laid low, no tree cutter comes up against us.'"<br /></i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The context of this passage is evident from the preceding verses that make it clear that the king of Babylon is being addressed. In addition, there is widespread celebration over his downfall. And on top of this, it appears that the events in this chapter have not taken place yet.</p>

    <p>So what is the significance of this? It is telling us that whoever this king of Babylon is, he is afflicting the entire earth. This is not just some kingdom from the past that conquered Judah. This is language that points to something much bigger!</p>

    <p>With this in mind, we can survey countless other passages that afford us further valuable insights! Let's look at Jeremiah 50: 24-26</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>"I set a snare for you and you were also caught, O Babylon,<br />
        While you yourself were not aware;<br />
        You have been found and also seized<br />
        Because you have engaged in conflict with the LORD."<br />
        The LORD has opened His armory<br />
        And has brought forth the weapons of His indignation,<br />
        For it is a work of the Lord GOD of hosts<br />
        In the land of the Chaldeans.<br />
        Come to her from the farthest border;<br />
        Open up her barns,<br />
        Pile her up like heaps<br />
        And utterly destroy her,<br />
        Let nothing be left to her.<br /></i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Although this passage points to details that appear to refer to pure military conflict, there are indications that something more is in play. For one thing, why would Jeremiah use this language to refer to solely the historical kingdom of Babylon if the kingdom of Judah was about to fall? It doesn't make sense. Why? It's because at the time Jeremiah was prophesying, Judah was the kingdom that deserved condemnation for turning away from the Lord. If anyone deserved to be denounced, it was them. But isn't it possible, then, that Jeremiah was looking forward to the time when Babylon would receive its just reward for pillaging the people of God in terms of an eye for an eye? This cannot be when one realizes that Babylon was not capable of receiving this type of judgment in the manner this passage describes! Look at the phrase, "Come to her from the farthest border," for example. How could this apply to the historical kingdom of Babylon? Nations around the earth would not have had the technological means to gang up on Babylon in the manner this phrase describes. This is referring to a judgment of a spiritual entity, not a physical one.</p>

    <p>There are many other passages that we could look at, but it is not the goal of this article to conclusively establish everything about the spiritual kingdom of Babylon. Instead, the more important thing to assess is the means by which this kingdom has damaged the Body of Christ. Indeed, this itself is a lengthy topic. But we can point to several key considerations.</p>

    <p>Babylon is the kingdom that served as the environment in which Daniel was brought up as a young prophet. Although Daniel is a book that is immensely complex, there are a few key pieces of information that we can glean.</p>

    <p>For starters, Daniel's three friends were commanded to bow down to worship a manmade idol by no less than the king himself! In other words, the king of Babylon wanted them to commit spiritual fornication. The Bible makes amply clear that to idolize anyone or anything other than God himself is spiritual fornication. And although Daniel's friends resisted this command, one can only imagine how tempting it might have been to sidestep the threats made by the king to have them thrown into a blazing furnace by simply bowing down before this image Nebuchadnezzar had set up. From this, we learn something about the spiritual realm of Babylon: Babylon is ruthless, tough, and desires us to commit spiritual fornication by renouncing God and serving him instead. In other words, Babylon tries everything in its power to cause us to turn away from God.</p>

    <p>There's more! Babylon also was a place where false prophets abounded. As evidence of this, we can refer to the second chapter. Here, we read an account in which numerous fortunetellers and soothsayers were called upon by the king to interpret a disturbing dream he had received the night before. It is clear from this tale that the king relied very heavily on having these men around him. As to why, we can reasonably guess that the king was not only ruthless, but he was someone who placed great emphasis upon divination and the occult. In other words, he relied upon the powers of spiritual darkness to inform him when it came to making decisions. From this, we see that the kingdom of Babylon is a realm that thrives upon spiritual powers that are not from God.</p>

    <p>In addition, we find that Babylon was a kingdom that was given to much dissipation and excess. This is clear in the account concerning Belshazzar's feast in the fifth chapter. What this tells us is that this is a realm that tends to veer toward gratification of impulses, whether they be sensual or lusty. The Holy Spirit, on the other hand, is about moderation and self-control. Therefore, it is useful to see from this that Babylon thrives on the weakness of believers when it comes to gratifying their desires. To be able to exercise self-control is something that many believers have not been able to accomplish when it comes to daily living.</p>

    <p>Let's also observe that Babylon was a kingdom that took particular pleasure in destroying the kingdom of Judah which was the holy symbol of God's grace and favor. When one reads the Scriptural account of how Judah fell toward the end of its existence, one cannot be but impressed at how quickly and decisively the Babylonians moved to build siege ramps upon the city of Jerusalem and then infiltrated the city once they had been suitably weakened to the point of helplessness. There is a parallel with how the kingdom of Babylon has weakened the Body of Christ! By cutting off supply to spiritual food and nourishment for the people of God, Babylon has dominated the Body of Christ to the point in which God's people are so weak they can barely feed themselves spiritually. There is a shocking parallel.</p>

    <p>It's time to bring in another Biblical passage of interest, Romans 10: 8-10</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>But what does it say? "THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART" - that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So why do we mention this well-known passage? It is oft-quoted, is it not? Yet, it is one of the most misunderstood passages in the Bible.</p>

    <p>Many people are of the belief that once a person has become born again into the kingdom of God, that this is a one-time occurrence. They have been conditioned into thinking this way because of many factors, but it needs to be mentioned that Babylon thrives on false teachings and doctrines. This is the connection to what we're discussing. In actuality, salvation is an ongoing process that needs to be sustained throughout the course of one's life, not by human effort, of course, but by continual heartfelt intimacy with the Lord. There is no connection with the scare tactic that many people have been bludgeoned with time and time again: that salvation depending on human effort is impossible. We are all well aware of that. But what needs to be borne in mind is that to make it into heaven, one cannot rely on some one-time event many years into the past and hope to please God in such a manner. That is foolishness.</p>

    <p>So what then can we conclude from all of this? One thing is for certain: Babylon is formidable. Those who deny its existence simply are not seeing what the Bible is saying. Yet, preachers in this day and age seem to be completely oblivious to its existence. And since most believers rely on preachers for their spiritual nourishment, they also are being misled. What to do? That is what we will be discussing.</p>
